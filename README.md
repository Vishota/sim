# Particles simulation on JavaScript  
## Particle types  
You can add any particles that interacts with each other according to any rules you want. I've created some, here they are  
### "Grain" particle
These particles trying to stay a certain distance between them: if distance is too big, they attract, otherwise they repel. They looks like gray circles

### "Antigrain" particle
They interact with each other in the same way as *Grain* particles, but interaction with sand grains is the opposite. They looks like green circles

### "Heavy" particle
*Heavy* particle mass is much larger than mass of grain or antigrain particle. Their peculiarity is that they always move at a constant speed

### "Join" particles  
*DiJoin* and *TriJoin* particles are can connect with each other
